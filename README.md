### Welcome to Rfirmata!

This is the skeleton of a package for an R implementation of the firmata protocol. 

It is based off lupeke's python-firmata library, the details of which are 
below.

https://github.com/lupeke/python-firmata

The goal of this project is to be able to interface directly with an Arduino board with R,
and then subsequently analyze recorded data in the R enviornment. We hope to streamline the 
process of collecting and analyzing data by bypassing the Sketch IDE.

After the package is complete, we will carry out a series of data analysis examples using 
the package and various statistic learning techniques to show highlight its functionality 
and efficiency.
